## Features

### User Roles

1. **Admin User**:

   - Can create, assign, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Can view and manage all tasks.

2. **Regular User**:
   - Can view tasks assigned to them or their group.
   - Can mark tasks as **Completed** or **In Progress**.

### Core Functionalities

1. **Task Creation and Assignment (Admin Only)**:

   - Admin users can create tasks with fields for **title**, **description**, **assigned user/group**, **due date**, and **priority**.
   - Tasks can be assigned to specific users or groups.

2. **Viewing Tasks**:

   - Admin users can view all tasks and filter by **user**, **group**, or **status** (completed, pending).
   - Regular users can only view tasks assigned to them or their group.

3. **Managing Tasks (Regular Users)**:

   - Regular users can mark their assigned tasks as **Completed** or **In Progress**.
   - Users can add comments to tasks for better communication.

4. **Task Status Tracking**:

   - Tasks can have statuses: **Pending**, **In Progress**, and **Completed**.

5. **Filtering and Sorting Tasks**:

   - Users can filter tasks by **status**, **priority**, or **assigned user/group**.
   - Admin users can sort tasks by **due date**, **priority**, or **creation date**.

6. **Responsive User Interface**:

   - Built with **Tailwind CSS** and **Flowbite** to provide a clean and responsive design.
   - Includes a **light/dark theme toggle button** in the navbar, allowing users to select their preferred theme.

7. **Basic Authorization**:

   - Admin users can access task creation and management pages, while regular users can only access their assigned task list.

8. **Form Validation**:

   - Integrated form validation for login, task creation, and task editing to ensure data integrity and provide user feedback on errors.

9. **Route Protection and Authentication Middleware**:
   - Implemented middleware to protect routes and handle user authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain pages, with appropriate redirection based on their authentication status and roles.
